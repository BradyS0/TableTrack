## Front end start instructions
  The css styling has been tested for google chrome only so far, other browsers may or may not look as expected  

### Prerequisites
  - [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v18.0 or higher)
  - npm (comes with Node.js)

*In a Terminal/Bash:*  
```bash
 # from repos root directory
 cd ./source/frontend/web

# once in ./frontend/web
 npm run start

 # this should start the front end on your default browser
 # If it doesnt and the Five Server is successfully running
 # Go to http://localhost:8484
```
